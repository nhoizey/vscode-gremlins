# Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Gremlins, it's people like you that make Gremlins such a great tool!

Gremlins is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into Gremlins itself.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

# Ground Rules

Responsibilities
* Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

# Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Gremlins?

You can start by looking through these "[good starter issue](https://github.com/nhoizey/vscode-gremlins/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+starter+issue+%F0%9F%90%A3%22+sort%3Areactions-1-desc+)" issues, which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two. These issues are sorted by total number of reactions. While not perfect, number of reactions is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://app.egghead.io/playlists/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# Getting started

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project
    * Send a pull request

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email <nicolas@hoizey.com> instead.
